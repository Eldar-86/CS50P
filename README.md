# CS50P
## This repository contains a collection of Python projects I've created during CS50P course.

### adieu.py
- Insipred by 'So long, Farewell' song from The Sound of Music. Code takes a list of names and adds 'and' before the last name.

### bank.py
- Inspired by Seinfeld The Invitations episode. The code returns $0 if greeted with hello, and less and less with anything but.
- There is also test_bank.py file which is intended for testing the main file.

### bitcion.py
- Takes two arguments: program name and amount of Bitcoin. The code returns current price from coincap.io

### camel.py
- Turns Pascal case into camel case

### coke.py
- Immitates a soda vending machine where coins need to be inserted for a can. Code returns either pending amount or change.

### deep.py
- Inspired by 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', the code returns positive response only if answer is a form of 42. This explores match/case function.

### einstein.py
- Very, very, veeeery simple code that returns Einstein's E=mc2

### emojize.py
- Code uses emoji lib to convert emojis

### extensions.py
- Code returns a format based on file name (if containing extension), using .lower().strip().split(".") methods and if in

### faces.py
- Code takes smiley or frowney and converts it from ASCII to Unicode

### figlet.py
- Code uses pyfiglet lib to generate text banner based on input. User can also select one of available fonts from the list when running the program via command line

### fuel.py
- Code takes a fraction, eg. 2/3, and returns it as percentage, unless the output is >2 or <98. Then it's either E or F.
- There is also test_fuel.py file which is intended for testing the main file.

### game.py
- Code uses random lib and generates a number between 1 and whatever the user puts in as level.

### grocery.py
- Code takes inputs from user and adds to a dictionary. Once End-Of-File (ctrl+d) is initiated, code prints the final list. If same item (key) is added multiple times, it is appended as value in dict.

### indoor.py
- Another very very simple code that just uses .lower() -- indoor voices.

### interpreter.py
- Code takes 3 input values where first and last need to be numbers, and middle one needs to be an operator. Code returns the result based on operator.
